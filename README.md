# Stella
visual indexing of websites
An alternative to the usual bookmarks with their hierarchical folders, Stella lets you label pages with tags by choosing icons.
Instead of placing a bookmark in a particular place within your bookmarks folders, you can find it using any of the labels you tagged it with.
Stella is a browser extension and can be used with desktop/laptop/Chromebook browsers or on a phone or tablet using a browser such as Kiwi which accepts extensions.
Pinning Stella in your browser lets you label a page in a couple of clicks.
The mechanism involves creating bookmarks in a dedicated Stella bookmarks folder, adding labels/tags preceded by '$' to the bookmark titles.
If you want to sync your Stella pages across devices/platforms you can use Floccus, selecting the Stella folder.
