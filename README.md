# Stella
<i>visual indexing of websites</i><br><br>
An alternative to the usual bookmarks with their hierarchical folders, Stella lets you label pages with tags by choosing icons.
You can stamp a page with one, two or several tags.<br><br>
Instead of placing a bookmark in a particular place within your bookmarks folders, you can find it using any of the labels you tagged it with.
A clothing retailer's site, for example, might be labelled with both the 'clothes' and the 'shopping' tags. Searching with either tag will include the page in the results,
while searching with both tags will just list sites with both tags.<br><br>
Stella is a browser extension and can be used with desktop/laptop/Chromebook browsers or on a phone or tablet using a browser such as Kiwi which accepts extensions.
Pinning Stella in your browser lets you label a page in a couple of clicks.<br><br>
The mechanism involves creating bookmarks in a dedicated Stella bookmarks folder, adding labels/tags preceded by '$' to the bookmark titles.
If you want to sync your Stella pages across devices/platforms you can use Floccus, selecting the Stella folder.
